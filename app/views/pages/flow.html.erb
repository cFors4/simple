  <h1>Flow</h1>

  <section id="intro">
    <h2>1. Introduction to Context/Frame</h2>
    <p>Flow is all about living, understanding the law of momentum, and what is most upstream will have outsized impact on your world. The principles of Flow can be applied to consciousness, energy, domains of life, as it all relates to an emergent prosses of life seeking to become more efficient.
      "Go with the flow" is a common phrase that means to adapt to the current situation or to let things happen naturally. It suggests a state of being in harmony with the current circumstances and a willingness to let go of control and expectations. This is essence is what happens when you aren't wasting energy, things will flow easier and more effortlessly.

  <section id="model">
    <h2>2. Model</h2>
    <p>A variety of domains and emergence flow in your life, and out of your life, inner and outer domains, we will discoer the highest leverage to the most emergent as an individual to collective, fundamental emergence to dynamic mechanisms of change. </p>

  <section id="analogy">
    <h2>3. Analogy</h2>
    <p>Flow is like a river, it is always moving, and it is always changing.It is a process of change that is always seeking a new equilibrium. This river may be powerful, wide, thin, or weak. This river may be calm or distrubed by obstacles. The river may have bottlenecks or wide open spaces. This is the flow of life.</p>

  <section id="metrics">
    <h2>4. Metrics/Heuristics</h2>
    <p>Fundamentally the metrics here will be asking how efficent or wasteful are we, and this will look different for everyone, as potential efficency could be a factor, also all domains we will cover will dramatically influence eachother as no part of is independent, even tho more upstream or fundamental.</p>

    <h2>5. Visual/Graph for Dashboard</h2>
    <p>A Sankey diagram would be an ideal visual representation for a Flow dashboard. This diagram would illustrate the flow of energy and resources from more fundamental, first-principle concepts to more emergent domains. The width of the flows in the diagram would represent the quantity of energy or resources, while the direction would show how they cascade through different levels of emergence.</p>
    <p>The diagram would start with fundamental energy concepts on the left side, such as physical and chemical energies. As we move to the right, these would flow into more complex domains like biological and informational. Any inefficiencies or "leaks" in the fundamental levels would be visually represented by thinner flows to the more emergent domains, illustrating how defects in basic principles can have cascading effects on higher-level processes.</p>
    <p>This Sankey diagram would provide a clear, intuitive visualization of how optimizing flow at fundamental levels can lead to greater efficiency and effectiveness across all domains of life and work.</p>

    <p>The width of each flow indicates the quantity of energy or resources, while the branching structure shows how fundamental efficiencies or deficiencies cascade into higher-level processes.</p>
