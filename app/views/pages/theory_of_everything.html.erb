    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1">
      <li>Consciousness exists</li>
      <li>Evolution exists</li>
      <li>Consciousness strives to evolve</li>
      <li>Our consciousness impacts everything around us</li>
      <li>Energy exists at a variety of configurations, vibrations and subtleties</li>
      <li>Consciousness impacts energy by modifying entropy</li>
      <li>Energy tends to higher entropy without consciousness</li>
      <li>Structures of energy and or consciousness are systems</li>
      <li>This includes the realms of subjective and objective, where the subjective is our conscious being, and where the objective is matter, information, and energy</li>
      <li>Evolving our being is evolving our consciousness, and this is done by tools and skills of consciousness, known as self-awareness, self-transformation, self-observation, and self-purification</li>
      <li>There are two fundamental substrates of consciousness and energy, where many emergent domains or substrates can be discovered, learned, mastered, ignored, prioritised or leveraged</li>
      <li>The process of betterment is one of lowering entropy and allowing entropy, and therefore investing into life-affirming dimensions and allowing death-affirming dimensions to decay. This is the dance of consciousness and energy, masculine and feminine, yang and yin, life and death</li>
      <li>A life well lived, is a life well utilised in a variety of frames, for spreading happiness, cultivating happiness, and serving ourselves and others to the greatest possible degree. To be and therefore become of power, clarity, wisdom, and peace is the most compassionate thing we can do for ourselves and others</li>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">III. Framework for Discovery and Evolution</h2>
    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2" start="14">
      <li>Frames that will aid us in this discovery are:
        <ol class="list-decimal list-inside ml-4 mt-2 space-y-1">
          <li>Flowing with the substrates and allocating our time, energy and attention more consciously. A process for energy utilisation and allocation based betterment for the whole, to increase overall flow and therefore power of leverage and speed</li>
          <li>Systems can span multiple substrates</li>
          <li>Building and optimising of systems with observability to generate a more conscious frame for improving what needs to be improved with higher, more effective feedback loops. A process for every systems goal of increasing progress to global optimums of state for the system as a whole, while existing within a conscious context where we can identify as clearly as possible the highest leverage points continually</li>
          <li>Consciousness evolution implies an increase in potential that has become actual as; lower entropy structures, more developed skill, increased momentum, and greater abundance in our lives</li>
          <li>What we have currently become up until now, is a result of continuous self-transformation, from learning in the playground of life. Developing virtuous parts of ourselves, but most importantly letting go of all the negativity and programs that were holding us back. This is a continual and ever more subtle process. A process of dissolution of our beliefs and perceptions that originate in aversion and cravings that generate self-inflicted unhappiness and misery. To journey on the discovery of our innate essence of compassion without conditions, manifesting as fulfilment of our total potential in reality of actuality, we mature as our most wise, loving, and best selves</li>
          <li>As we reduce our own misery we no longer propagate it to others. Showing up as our best selves results in becoming our most peaceful and compassionate selves</li>
          <li>This leads us to being, here, now, as the observer, realising more and more what we are is not our sensations or situation. A process of non-reacting/non-distracting with equanimity and peace, via patience and persistence of mindful self-awareness, moment to moment</li>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">IV. Implications and Emergent Concepts</h2>
    <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-2">A. Choice and Evolution</h3>
    <p class="mb-2">The combination of our definition of consciousness as "awareness that makes choices" and axiom 3, "Consciousness strives to evolve," suggests a fundamental relationship between choice-making and evolution. This implies that:</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-1">
      <li>The ability to make choices is inherently linked to a drive for evolution.</li>
      <li>Each choice made by a conscious entity potentially contributes to its evolution.</li>
      <li>The process of evolution itself may be viewed as a series of choices and how the choices are learned from over time.</li>
      <li>As consciousness evolves, its capacity for making more complex or refined choices may increase, accelerating the evolutionary process.</li>
      <li>The quality and nature of choices made by conscious entities could be seen as indicators of their evolutionary stage or progress.</li>
    </ol>
